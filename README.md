# Graphql practical

As a part of completion of graphql goal I have created a POC on graphql with apollo in frontend and express-graphql with backend.

# Installation and setup instruction for Frontend
Clone down this repository. You will need [node](https://nodejs.org/en) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed globally on your machine.

Installation : 
 ` npm install`

To run locally :
 `npm run dev`

Visit app : 
 https://localhost:3000

# Installation and setup instruction For Backend
Go the `server` folder from a root directory.

Installation : 
 ` npm install`

Create your mongodb database and add **connection string** in `.env` file

And add `.env` file and take reference from `.env.example `

To run locally :
 `nodemon start`
